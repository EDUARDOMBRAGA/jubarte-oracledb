# About

This examples have the purpose to show how jubarte works and are didactic only. 
Do not use them as architecture reference or something like that.

In the next commits I will add some database scripts to be able to execute samples stored procedures.

# Instructions

To run this examples you will need to export some environment variables:

* ORACLE_USER: user name to connect 
* ORACLE_PASSWORD: user password
* ORACLE_CONNECTION_STRING: ip, port and service name

Then you just need to run "npm install" and "node app.js"
